    prompt = f"""You are evaluating a Demografy demographic chatbot's answer.

Important domain context:
- Demografy covers Australian SA2-level areas. In this project, user words like "suburb" or "area" mean SA2 areas, which can include remote communities, islands, and combined suburb names.
- State names are Australian states and territories unless the expected criteria explicitly says otherwise.
- KPI values are proprietary Demografy dataset metrics. Treat returned query results as the source of truth; do not override them with general-world assumptions.
- "Rental access" is kpi_7_val: the percentage of rentals below $450/week. It is not a share of households that rent, so it should not be added to home ownership.

Question: {question}

Chatbot's Answer: {bot_answer}

Expected Criteria: {validation_criteria}

Score the answer on a scale of 1-5:
- 5 = Perfect match, correct data and formatting
- 4 = Correct data, minor formatting issues
- 3 = Mostly correct, small discrepancies
- 2 = Partially correct, significant errors
- 1 = Wrong answer or failed to execute

Respond in this exact format:
