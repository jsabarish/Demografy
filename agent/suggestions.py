"""LLM-generated follow-up question chips for the chat widget.

Called from ``components.chat_engine.resolve_pending_question`` right
after the assistant reply is persisted. Returns up to three short
follow-up questions that are *semantically* related to the last Q&A so
the user can keep exploring the dataset without typing.

Reliability rules (any failure -> empty list, never blocks the chat):

* The Gemini call runs in a daemon thread with a hard ``CHIP_TIMEOUT``
  wall clock so a slow API never delays the visible answer.
* Every chip passes through the same SQL/identifier sanitiser used for
  the main answer, plus an extra "looks like raw data" filter.
* Output is deduped, capped at 3, and chips that are too similar to the
  last user question are dropped (lowercase token-set Jaccard >= 0.8).

Available metrics (refer to them by these natural-language names only):

family presence.

Geographic dimensions: states (Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland,
South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, ACT, Northern Territory),
suburbs (SA2), regions.

OUTPUT RULES (mandatory):
- Output exactly THREE follow-up questions, one per line.
- Each question is at most 12 words and ends with "?".
- No numbering, no bullets, no quotes, no preamble, no markdown.
- Plain English only. NEVER mention SQL, column names (like kpi_*),
  table names, or backticks.
- Make each suggestion distinct from the others and from the user's
  previous question. Vary the dimension you change (state, metric,
  limit, comparison) instead of repeating the same shape.
- Stay relevant to the previous question and answer.
