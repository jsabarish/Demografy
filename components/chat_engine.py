"""Chat lifecycle: take a user question -> show pending -> call agent -> render.

Owns all session-state mutations for ``chat_messages``. The flow is split
into two phases so the iframe can show a "Thinking..." bubble during the
potentially slow ``ask()`` call:

  Phase 1 (handle_new_question):
    - Append the user message to chat history.
    - Apply RBAC: if limit reached, append a single assistant message and stop.
    - Otherwise mark ``chat_pending`` True (so the next render shows the
      Thinking bubble) and stash the question for phase 2 to pick up.
    - Trigger ``st.rerun()`` so the user sees the bubble immediately.

  Phase 2 (resolve_pending_question):
    - Detect that we have a stashed pending question on this run, call the
      agent, append the assistant reply, increment ``question_count``, and
      append a soft warning if the user is approaching their tier limit.
