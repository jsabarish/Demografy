"""Session state initialisation and URL-based user restore.

Centralised so every component reads from a single, predictable shape.
On user restore (either via ``?u=`` URL parameter or a fresh login) we
also hydrate the active chat thread from disk so the chat widget
renders the prior conversation immediately.

Threading model
---------------
``chat_thread_id`` identifies which conversation the chat widget is
currently showing and writing to. ``hydrate_chat_history`` resolves it
to the most recently active thread (if any) so users return to where
they left off; otherwise it mints a fresh id without materialising a
file - the file appears on the first ``append_message`` call.
