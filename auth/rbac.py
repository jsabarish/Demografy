Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Demografy Insights Chatbot.

What this file does:
- Looks up a user in the dev_customers BigQuery table using their user_id
- Returns their tier (free / basic / pro)
- Enforces question limits per session based on tier

Tiers:
    free  → 5  questions per session
    basic → 20 questions per session
    pro   → 50 questions per session

No passwords — login is by user_id only (as per project spec).
